# Validates the inference-path audit trail (stage 1b):
#
#   T14  one request, one key: an admitted request leaves exactly one
#        completion and one settle joined by request_id, a refused one
#        leaves exactly one deny carrying a non-empty request_id and the
#        tenant of the credential that was refused
#   T4   the record's tokens are the tokens that were charged, for a split
#        non-streaming body and for an SSE stream with include_usage
#   T2   the drop counter is reachable: with the writer stalled the data
#        path keeps serving and the drop counter rises
#   T18  what was dropped before the writer is named exactly, per producer
#        and per stream, and nothing lands unattributed
#   T21  two producers enqueuing out of order is not a drop
#
# The join key is the client's own X-Request-Id: the gateway adopts a
# supplied one before the admission gate decides, so every record of a
# request carries the value this script chose and no assertion has to
# guess which record belongs to which request.
#
# Rules: every refusal asserts the reason, not just the status; whether a
# refused request reached the backend is read from the backend's own
# namespace, never inferred from the gateway's answer; a count that could
# be satisfied by an empty trail is paired with a floor.

# loxilb-inference-gateway

An **inference-aware L4/L7 load balancer for LLM serving fleets**. It is a fork of
[loxilb](https://github.com/loxilb-io/loxilb) that keeps the same GoLang/eBPF data path and
adds routing that understands how vLLM, SGLang, TensorRT-LLM and llama.cpp actually serve
requests: KV-cache locality, prefill/decode phases and streaming responses.

Every AI capability is opt-in per load-balancer rule. With none enabled, the gateway behaves
exactly like upstream loxilb, so one gateway can carry both classic cloud-native traffic and
inference traffic.

## Key capabilities

| Capability | What it does | Guide |
|---|---|---|
| KV-cache-aware routing | Sends each request to the endpoint whose KV cache already holds the longest prefix of the prompt, by prefix-hash affinity or by the engine's own cache events | [KV-cache routing][kv] |
| Prefill/Decode disaggregation | Splits each request across prefill and decode pools, with KV-transfer coordination and session affinity | [P/D disaggregation][pd] |
| Model-name routing | Routes by the requested model to per-model endpoint pools | [Model load balancing][model-lb] |
| SSE streaming | Stream-aware proxying with idle-timeout suppression and a runaway cap | [SSE & quota][sse] |
| AI traffic governance | API keys, JWT, model authorization and request/token quotas, enforced before dispatch | [AI traffic governance][gov] |
| MCP gateway | Session-sticky proxying of Model Context Protocol server pools | [MCP gateway][mcp-gw] |
| Observability | Prometheus metrics and provisioned Grafana dashboards for L4, L7 and AI traffic | [Monitoring][mon] |
| Classic load balancing | Everything upstream loxilb does: L4/NAT, Kubernetes service LB, SCTP/telco, HA | [upstream docs][upstream-docs] |

Engine support differs per feature. Check the [engine capability matrix][matrix] and
[choose your engine][choose] before designing a deployment.

## Quick start

Run the gateway on a Linux host with Docker. Use a release tag you have tested; `:latest` is
for throwaway evaluation only.

```bash
docker run -u root --cap-add SYS_ADMIN --restart unless-stopped --privileged \
  -dit --net=host -v /dev/log:/dev/log -v /opt/loxilb/config:/etc/loxilb \
  --name loxilb ghcr.io/loxilb-io/loxilb-inference-gateway:<RELEASE_TAG>
```

- **Mount `/etc/loxilb` from the host.** The gateway stores its configuration snapshot there
  and restores it at boot; without the mount, configuration is lost when the container is
  recreated.
- **Allow at least 2 GiB of memory** if you set a container memory limit.

Then create a rule through the REST API on port `11111`. This one is **engine-exact
KV-cache-aware routing**: the gateway subscribes to each vLLM replica's KV-cache event
stream, tokenizes every prompt itself, and sends the request to the replica that already
holds the longest cached prefix.

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:11111/netlox/v1/config/loadbalancer \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
  "serviceArguments": {
    "externalIP": "192.0.2.20", "port": 8080, "protocol": "tcp",
    "sel": 0, "mode": 4, "host": "192.0.2.20", "sse_mode": true,
    "kvExactMode": 3, "kvEngineType": "vllm", "kvZmqPort": 5557, "kvBlockSize": 16 },
  "endpoints": [
    { "endpointIP": "198.51.100.11", "targetPort": 8000, "weight": 1 },
    { "endpointIP": "198.51.100.12", "targetPort": 8000, "weight": 1 },
    { "endpointIP": "198.51.100.13", "targetPort": 8000, "weight": 1 } ]}'
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `mode: 4` | L7 fullproxy, required for every AI feature |
| `kvExactMode: 3` | Engine-exact routing over a single pool (`1` is the prefill/decode topology) |
| `kvEngineType` | Which engine's cache contract to follow: `vllm` or `sglang` |
| `kvZmqPort`, `kvBlockSize` | Must match the engine's event port and `--block-size` |
| `sse_mode` | Stream-aware proxying for token streams |

Each vLLM replica publishes its cache events:

```bash
PYTHONHASHSEED=0 vllm serve <MODEL> --port 8000 --block-size 16 \
  --prefix-caching-hash-algo sha256_cbor \
  --kv-events-config '{"enable_kv_cache_events":true,"publisher":"zmq","endpoint":"tcp://*:5557"}'
```

The gateway also needs the model's `tokenizer.json` staged under `/etc/loxilb/tokenizers/`;
without it the rule silently falls back to load-based routing. The addresses above are
placeholders. See [KV-cache routing][kv] for tokenizer staging and the zero-engine-change
alternative (prefix-hash affinity, `sel: 8`), [P/D disaggregation][pd] for split
prefill/decode pools, and the [Quickstart][quickstart] for the full path from readiness to
cleanup.

## Where it fits

One Go/eBPF binary covers L4 through inference-aware L7, with no Envoy, sidecar chain or
mandatory Kubernetes control plane. It is not a multi-provider API proxy (it load-balances
your own engines) and not an orchestrator (it does not schedule or scale engine pods). If you
only need the base cloud-native load balancer, use
[upstream loxilb](https://github.com/loxilb-io/loxilb) directly.

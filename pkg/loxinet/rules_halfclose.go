// halfCloseResolve returns the half-close mode a rule will store (enum
// sp_hold_mode): on create the declared value, on a replace the stored one
// unless the request names the field, where inherit returns it to unset.
//
// hold is refused where the data plane would never hold a client, or has not
// been shown to: a service that is not fullproxy (only the proxy relays an
// answer it could hold a client for), one whose clients speak TLS (the hold
// leaves TLS connections alone), and a P/D service (not yet measured). The
// check is on the rule as it will stand after a replace - the mode it keeps
// and the P/D switch it is given - so neither order slips through: hold on a
// P/D rule, nor P/D switched on under a stored hold. The security mode cannot
// change on a live rule, so a replace is judged on the stored one, whatever
// the request says. A snapshot restore replay is let through as unset with a
// warning instead, so that one field cannot keep the rule from coming back.

// ============================================================================
// AI ADMISSION GATE (capacity) METRICS - per service, per model pool
// ============================================================================
// The capacity gate keeps its state on the pool (loxilb-ebpf/common/
// sockproxy_fc.h): the units in flight at the service and at each endpoint
// per role, the ceilings in force, and one counter per decision the gate
// took. Without this file none of that leaves the process, and an operator
// reading a 429 storm cannot tell a ceiling set too low from a backend that
// stopped answering.
//
// Collection follows the shaper's idiom in qos_shaper_metrics.go: the 10s
// RunSockproxyMetrics cycle refreshes a Go-side store (writer) and the
// collector emits ConstMetrics from it on scrape (reader). The C call walks
// the service list under the proxy read lock, off the scrape path.
//
// The bounded queue rides on the same row: the requests waiting for a unit,
// the depth and wait window in force, and a histogram of how long the
// resumed ones waited, so an operator can tell a queue that absorbs bursts
// from one that only delays the 429.
//
// Every model pool of an AI-gateway service gets a row whatever the gate's
// mode. A pool with the gate off reports mode 0 and zeros, so the mode
// series answers "is this pool gated" without a second source of truth, and
// the gauges read 0 rather than being absent. Counters are exported raw: a
// pool that is deleted and re-created starts from zero, which Prometheus
// already reads as a counter reset.
// ============================================================================

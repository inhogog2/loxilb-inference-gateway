// Half-close observation
// ============================================================================
// The proxy's datapath (loxilb-ebpf/common/sockproxy_hc.c) records what a
// client's FIN looked like when it arrived and how responses progressed
// towards the client, and hands the cumulative state over in the metrics
// snapshot. These families export it. They are observation only: nothing in
// the proxy decides anything from them.
//
// The C side keeps cumulative le buckets like the TTFB histogram, so the same
// sanitize/merge treatment applies (torn reads within one snapshot, and never
// going backwards across snapshots), and the collector emits const metrics on
// scrape.
//
// The label values below are the C enums' order in sockproxy_hc_core.h; the
// snapshot dimensions are fixed there and mirrored in the cgo preamble.
